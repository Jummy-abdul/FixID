# FixID — Organization Portal Prototype

Interactive prototype of **FixID**, Seamfix's reusable identity and credential platform, from an organization administrator's perspective.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm test           # unit + integration tests (Vitest, Testing Library)
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Demo data is generated on first load and persisted in `localStorage` (`fixid.prototype.state`). Reset it from **Settings → Demo data**.

## Product boundaries modelled

| Owner | Owns | In this prototype |
|---|---|---|
| **ID Switch** | Canonical identity (name, email, phone, DOB) | `services/mockIdSwitch.ts`. Never copied into FixID state; FixID stores only `idSwitchId`. |
| **FixID** | Org context, credential types, issuance, verification activities, transactions, audit | App store (`store/`) |
| **Seamfix Wallet** | Holder experience | `services/mockWallet.ts`. FixID tracks delivery status only. |
| **Fixiam** | Workforce IAM (optional) | Shown as an optional integration and attribute source. |

## Architecture

```
src/
  domain/            types, labels, trust rules (assurance/fallback), metrics
  data/              deterministic seed + simulated ID Switch registry
  store/             reducer, org-scoped selectors, localStorage persistence
  services/          service interfaces + mock adapters (ID Switch, issuance, wallet)
  components/ui      shared design system (Button, Card, Table, Modal, Toast, Form…)
  components/domain  FixID components (DigitalIdCard, PolicyFlow, StatusBadges…)
  layout/            shell: sidebar, org switcher, global search, admin menu
  pages/             route destinations
```

- **One connected store.** Every page reads from `useOrgData()`, which scopes all entities to the current organization. Nothing is hardcoded per page.
- **Services behind interfaces.** `ServicesProvider` takes a `Services` object, so mock adapters can be swapped for real ones without UI changes.
- **Filters live in the URL**, so dashboard tiles deep-link to filtered lists.
- **Planned features** open an explicitly labelled dialog (`components/domain/PlannedFeature.tsx`) and never simulate success.

## Navigation

| Section | Item | Route |
|---|---|---|
| — | Dashboard | `/` |
| User Management | Users · Groups | `/users` · `/groups` (planned shell) |
| Credential Management | Credentials · Templates | `/credentials` · `/templates` (card designs), `/templates/credential-types` |
| Verification | Activities · Verification History | `/activities` · `/verification-history` |
| Administration | Audit Log · Settings | `/audit` · `/settings` |

Previous paths (`/people`, `/transactions`, `/card-designs`, `/credential-types`, including detail pages and query strings) redirect to their new routes.

The top bar contains only the App Launcher and the profile menu (`/profile`). Applications are listed in `src/config/applications.ts`; external destinations are read from `VITE_FIXIAM_URL` and `VITE_ADMIN_URL` and shown as "Not configured" until set.

Deployed on Vercel from this repository. `vercel.json` rewrites all paths to `index.html` so deep links and refresh work; other hosts need the same fallback.

## Demo workspaces

The app opens in **Crestfield Academy**, a brand-new organization with no users, credentials or activities, so the first-time journey runs on real data. Northbridge University, Meridian Health Group and Lagos Tech Summit are established sample organizations. Switch under **Settings → Demo data**.

## Sign in, sign up and onboarding

- **Demo account:** `demo@fixid.app` / `FixIDDemo2026!` (demo mode only). Opens the existing sample organizations; Settings → Demo data and the dashboard preview are available to this account only.
- **Sign up:** `/signup` (email) → `/verify-email` (6-digit code) → `/create-password` → `/onboarding/personal` → `/onboarding/organization` → first-time dashboard of a new, empty organization.
- **Development verification code:** `123456`. No email provider is connected, so no message is actually sent; the code is accepted only in demo mode, expires after 10 minutes and allows 5 attempts. Resend restarts the timer and attempts.
- **Forgot password** (`/forgot-password`) records nothing and sends nothing; it shows the same confirmation for any address. Reset links aren't implemented.
- **Routes:** signed-out visitors are sent to `/signin`; signed-in administrators who haven't finished onboarding resume it; Sign out is in the account menu.

**This is prototype authentication, not a security boundary.** Accounts live in local storage (`fixid.auth.v1`) with passwords salted and hashed (PBKDF2-SHA256), and the sign-up session in session storage (never the code itself). Route checks are client-side only. Production needs a backend identity provider for accounts, email delivery of verification and reset codes, password storage, sessions and authorization. Demo mode is on unless the build sets `VITE_DEMO_AUTH=off`, which disables the demo account and the development code.

Each signed-up organization has its own records (`ownerAccountId` on the organization). The signed-in administrator can only act in their own organization; resetting demo data keeps organizations created through sign-up.

## Administrators & Roles

Settings → **Administrators & Roles** (`/settings?tab=admins`, `&view=roles` for the role catalogue). Administrators are organization-scoped records (`data.administrators`), separate from the users an organization manages; one person can be both.

| Role | Can do | Portal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organization Admin | Everything below, plus manage administrators, settings, users, groups and audit log | Yes |
| Credential Manager | View users; view, configure and issue credentials | Yes |
| Verification Manager | View outcomes, manage verification activities, assign verifiers | Yes |
| Verifier | Perform assigned verifications (ready for activity assignment) | **No** |
| Viewer / Auditor | Read-only: administrators, users, credentials, verification, audit log | Yes |

Roles are lists of permissions (`src/domain/roles.ts`), so custom roles can be added later without changing the checks.

**Rules:** you can only grant roles whose permissions you hold (Verifier can be granted by anyone who can assign verifiers); you can't change or deactivate an administrator with permissions you lack; you can't deactivate yourself; the organization always keeps at least one active Organization Admin. Duplicate, existing, deactivated and pending invitations are refused; an expired invitation can be replaced or resent. Every change is written to the audit log.

**Invitations are simulated.** No email provider is connected and no email is sent. The invited person joins by signing up with the invited email address (code `123456`) within 7 days, and lands directly in the inviting organization with the invited roles.

**Try another role:** sign in as the demo account, invite e.g. `cm@example.org` as Credential Manager, sign out, sign up with that email. Navigation, actions and direct URLs follow the role; a Verifier sees a "no portal access" screen; deactivating an administrator removes their access on their next action. Sessions expire after 12 hours.

**Enforcement is client-side only.** Permissions are checked in three places — hidden/disabled actions, route guards and the store reducer — but all run in the browser and can be bypassed. Production must enforce the same rules on the server for every request.

## Add user journey

`/users/new` (from the dashboard or Users) offers **Add manually**; **Select existing** and **Bulk upload** are marked Planned.

`/users/new/manual`:

1. **Select identifier**: pick a saved identifier, or set one up from a suggestion (Matric Number, Staff ID, Employee Number, Membership Number, Other) in the **identifier drawer**.
2. **User information**: name, email/phone, and the identifier value (manual) or a generated preview. No photo upload: facial enrollment is a separate, user-initiated live capture (planned), tracked as its own status (not enrolled, pending, enrolled, expired, failed). **Create user** runs a simulated ID Switch check: new or confidently matched people are created immediately; existing members, conflicts and name-only matches need attention first.
3. **Create user** saves the user, then a **User created successfully** modal shows the assigned identifier and asks whether to issue a digital ID: **Yes, issue ID** continues in Credential Management; **Not now** returns to Users.

## Users

`/users` shows four KPI cards (Total, Active, Inactive, Portrait Enrolled) and a table with selection, serial numbers, identifier (name and value), email, user status and portrait enrollment. Each row's ⋯ menu offers **View Details**, **Deactivate/Activate User** (confirmed, audited, credentials untouched) and **Send/Resend Enrollment Link** for active users who aren't enrolled. Selecting rows shows a bulk toolbar (**Send Enrollment Link**, **Activate Users**, **Deactivate Users**) that only offers actions some selected users qualify for; the confirmation lists how many will be affected and why others are skipped.

**Developer note:** enrollment links are simulated in this prototype. No email is sent; the invitation is recorded (one open link per user, resend allowed after a minute) and enrollment becomes Pending. The UI uses production wording on purpose. Identity lookups and Seamfix Wallet delivery are also simulated (`src/services/mock*.ts`); the administrator UI doesn't describe these internals. Settings → Demo data has a switch to make the identity service unavailable for testing.

`/users/:id` has a profile header (portrait or initials, name, status) and three tabs: **Profile Details** (with Record Information), **Credentials** (every issued credential, card preview, and Issue Credential), and **Recent Verifications**. The active tab is kept in the URL (`?tab=`).

The sample organization has one enrolled user set up to show a portrait. Put a licensed demo photo at `public/samples/portrait-sample.jpg` to display it; without the file, initials are shown. It's labelled as a sample image, not an enrollment capture.

## Credential Management

- **`/credentials`**: a single empty state ("No credentials configured yet" → Create credential) until the first configuration exists; then a table of configurations (SN, name, identifier, issued count, date created, ⋯ View Details / Edit).
- **Create / Edit** use one drawer with two steps: **Choose template** (four starter templates: Classic/Modern × Landscape/Portrait, each with a front and back) → **Configure credential** (name, identifier, effective date, expiration, renewable) with a live preview of the chosen template. Saving never issues anything; after creating, *Assign now* or *I'll do this later*. Edits apply to future issuance only: each issued credential keeps a snapshot of the name, template and identifier label it was issued with.
- **`/credentials/configurations/:id`**: Configuration tab (rules + template front/back) and Issued To tab (individual recipients, Issue credential).
- **`/credentials/issue`**: the one assignment flow: select a configuration (or create one) → select a recipient when none was carried in → review (collects effective/expiry dates when the rule asks for them) → issue. Context is carried in the URL (`?recipients=…&credential=…&from=new-user|user|config`).
- **`/credentials/:credentialId`**: the one Issued Credential Details page (card front/back, issuance information, activity history), opened from Issued To and from a user's Credentials tab. `?from=user:<id>` or `?from=config:<id>` decides where Back goes.
- **`/credentials/issued`**: every issued credential with lifecycle filters (used by dashboard shortcuts).

Templates are rendered by one component (`src/components/credentials/CredentialCard.tsx`) everywhere a card appears.

## Data model

- `Organization` → `CredentialType` (identifier configuration, effective date, validity, renewal, lifecycle) → `CardDesign` (one default per org)
- `IdentifierConfig` (stable id, name, manual or generated pattern, persisted sequence)
- `Member` (FixID context, references `idSwitchId`, holds one organizational identifier) → `Credential` (Member × CredentialType, with wallet delivery status)
- `VerificationActivity` (purpose, eligibility, primary + fallback methods, assurance, outcome, schedule) → `Transaction` (result, decision, assurance achieved, fallback used, reason)
- `AuditEvent` (actor, action, resource, result)

## Milestones

- **M1: Product foundation** (current). Layout, navigation, dashboard, all route destinations, component system, connected data model, persistence, simulated organization context.
- M2: Guided "Add person & issue" journey (ID Switch resolution → link → minimal context → credential), issue additional credential, credential type editor.
- Later: credential lifecycle actions, card design editor, verification activity builder, verifier simulator, exports.
